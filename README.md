I don't think this program will ever get out of beta... There are too many bugs I don't know how to fix and the code is just... yeah. Like 50% of the whole thing is just hard coded features. No one downloads this anyway, so I don't really care :) If someone would REALLY want me to fix the bugs and actually release bug-less version, open an issue and I'll try my best.
